                                                         “HEALTH”

We have total 6 ideas in Health sector. The 6th one is “State Wise Sanitation Facilities Available in India”, although it is related with health but it seems to be the project of Sanitation sector. So, we will be working on only 5 ideas. Those 5 ideas are:

SMS and web based module for promotion of breast feeding in mothers and proper weaning foods to reduce infant mortality and malnutrition in children
People Health Data Management
Medi-Friend
Community Information on Health-care Services in India
